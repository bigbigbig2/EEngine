# OEngine Web Geometry Cooker

Browser-first `portable-single` Nyx geometry producer. It accepts the canonical binary input from `WebGeometryCookerAbiV1`, runs the full meshlet/Group/simplification/refine/hierarchy/page pipeline in WASM, and exposes decoded Geometry Product sections. It has no filesystem, cgltf, LZ4, WebGPU, OEGPACK writer, or Native CLI dependency.

Build with an activated Emscripten SDK:

```powershell
emcmake cmake -S tools/oengine-web-geometry-cooker -B tools/oengine-web-geometry-cooker/build-wasm -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build tools/oengine-web-geometry-cooker/build-wasm
```

`OENGINE_WEB_COOK_INITIAL_MEMORY_MB` and `OENGINE_WEB_COOK_MAXIMUM_MEMORY_MB` are build-time ceilings. A CookSession must impose a smaller per-session WASM/output budget through the ABI; the module ceiling is not admission credit.

The native oracle uses the same sources and ABI without emulating a file workflow:

```powershell
npm run test:web-geometry-cooker-core
```

That oracle proves producer ABI, Nyx algorithm execution, negative validation and determinism. It does not replace an actual Emscripten build or Dedicated Worker/browser evidence.

The checked-in browser artifact under `src/assets/web-cook/wasm/vendor/` was
built with Emscripten SDK 6.0.9 (release `f04ea239d533260dd1db760dd2d668d5f9a88d6b`)
using the command above and the pinned Nyx hashes enforced by CMake:

```text
oengine-web-geometry-cooker.mjs   SHA-256 93c183863acb85e7c9550e14cf19cf5d6510c9b4fec177630b444cccbc8118d8
oengine-web-geometry-cooker.wasm  SHA-256 c4ff7f9d0905ab6412d090443ee07cf179b03b59ed3e47bc00da762bc9630402
```

The cooker emits one Product asset per canonical material domain, so a
multi-mesh GLB keeps independently addressable primitives. Rebuild the artifact
and refresh both hashes whenever the C++ sources change.
